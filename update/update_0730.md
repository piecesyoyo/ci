## Latest Update ðŸ“£ (July 30, 2023)

Today, we're thrilled to announce an important enhancement to our Python Code Interpreter. The update brings the interpreter's functionality even closer to the official Python interpreter, providing a robust context of environment variables. This enhancement allows GPT to generate less code, making your coding tasks more efficient and streamlined.

### Reduced Code Generation ðŸ“‰

One of the most significant improvements is the reduction in the amount of generated code. With this update, we've managed to reduce the code generation by up to 30% for specific functionalities. This means you can now achieve the same results with less code, enhancing readability and maintainability.
